# Restrictions:
* The pipe is static, ie, unchangable, so does the facet.
* The emotional trauma of wasting water is unbearable (start to wash with cold water though showering with it is still not quite within reason.)
* One movable hardware solution that moves undesired cold water to desired place and time for use, ie. a storage utitlity.

# Solution:
- A simple pipe and cover that can guide the cold water to another container until the water runs hot or the container fills up.

# Possible components
1. Shape shifting material upon temperature change, or an electronic solution for monitoring water temperature
2. water bucket
3. elastic cover for water bucket that provides a seal and an inlet for the pipe.

Yeh.
