Randomness. Sort of. This is largely an experiment on annoyance solving.

###How is it organized.
1. Every branch is a project which has its own folder.
2. Try to solve the problem described by the branch name and the readme file inside the individual folder.
3. Merge the branch only when the problem has been demonstratably solved.

That is it.
